# telegram_audio_stickers
Telegram, popular messaging app, has stickers. They are like custom emojis, however can be made out of any pictures/gifs. I believe stickers can also be made out of sounds. Telegram already has a built-in functionality of in-line bots and I want to build on it to add a list of audio recordings that will be sent to chat in form of voice message.
